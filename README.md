# Computer Mouse Conference : Build your own "Mouse" Workshop


Due to modern advancements in Microcontroller Technology, we now have the ability to build our own Computer Mouse interfaces with only a few lines of code.  This session aims to engage participants in a dialogue about Systems of Control, API design and Human Computer Interaction. Using MKRZero microcontrollers we will explore the Arduino Mouse library, and build our own experimental mouse interfaces to the computer.  We will explore what commands we would need to make a traditional mouse work, and then spend time breaking those commands apart and creating something entirely our own.  At the end of this workshop participants will become familiar with the suite of mouse gestures, and be able to navigate the Arduino Mouse library.  

#### Prerequisites 
Participants are strongly encouraged to have basic knowledge of Arduino and Physical Computing.

### Schedule
| Time Period  | Overview | Description | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 0 - 10min | Introduction | We'll spend this time doing introductions, getting to know each other, and setting the objectives for the workshop |
| 10 - 30min | The Mouse and the Computer | We'll spend this time discussing the components of basic Human Computer Interaction as it relates to the Mouse, and specific Gestures related to The Mouse.   |
| 30-50mi | Deep Dive into Software | Once we learn and discuss the different aspects of the mouse we will take a look at the Arduino Mouse Library to understand how we can build our own interactions with the Mouse.   |
| 50-90min | Hands On Workshop | For the hands on portion of this session we will be asking participants to look at one action they take on the computer each day.  We are going to take a look at this speicifc task, and build software that forces you to interact with this daily routine through a different lens.    |



### Equipment
All participants will be provided with MKRZero Arduinos, a set of push buttons, and given access to wires.  Workshop attendees are highly encouraged to bring either Arduino compatable joysticks and any analog sensors they may have.
